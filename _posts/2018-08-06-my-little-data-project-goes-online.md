This is intended to be the ‘Hello, World’ of this project page.

I’ve been trying to get better at Python, both because I enjoy the challenge of it, and because I am increasingly interested in pursuing a future path that includes some relatively hands on data analysis.

Like thousands before me, I have decided that if I am going to put work in and get better at this, I need to have a project before me. And like many of those thousands, I have turned to baseball as the source of my curiosity and the basis of my project.

Baseball is somewhat of an odd choice for me - I’m Australian, I have never seen a professional inning let alone a professional game, and I’ve never played the sport. But there is good reason  for my interest. Both my girlfriend (American) and my best mate (Australian) are passionate about the sport. There exists a wealth of information about sabermetrics online and in print. Perhaps most importantly, baseball‘s qualities that lend itself to simple, but powerful, statistical analysis.

In essence, this project is very simple. I’m using an elo model to predict the results of future games based upon the results of past games, in a consistent and quantifiable way. More details on how this works in future will be written.

The perfectionist within me causes me to struggle with pushing things forward. I want them to be finished before anybody sees them. It can cause me to falter before the very first step. So often, all that needs to be done is to start, and the rest follows. By moving this project to an online space, I’m hoping to force myself to present honestly unfinished work. There’s also an element of nurturing pride in craft. Hello world, I made this thing.

You can find the code used both to host this page, and to run the model, [here](https://github.com/gabrieldwyer/baseball_elo_ratings).
