A program that:
1. Scrapes the web for the league's results
2. Saves the data as a csv file
3. Uses the data to calculate elo rating

Some notes on nomenclature:
As the elo system is being applied here to a game that has scores, it is important to be precise and careful when it comes to word usage:
- the elo value is known as a rating
- the value is W/L/D (1/0/0.5) respectively. This is often known as the expected score in elo methods, but I think it makes more sense to call it a value
- the score is the 'baseball score' in the traditional sense i.e. 12 v. 5

The current code could do with a few changes to improve its readability and
flexibility:
i. changing one variable to access the different leagues (done)
ii. changing the scraping method to a dictionary method
iii. include headers on the csv file
iv. write the elo rating calculated into the csv file

v. implement the grade variable flexibility as a user input
vi. split up the expected value calculation?
- used in multiple functions, plus could improve mathematical readability

There are a few areas for extension, including:
4. predict the outcomes for next match/future games based on ELO ratings
  a) scrape the fixture, find the next game
  b) calculate win chance
5. graph the change in elo rating over time
6. include a margin of victory metric of some kind to refine the model
7. Defensive vs. Offensive elo ratings?
8. Calculate and include a kind of 'home field advantage'
9. scheduled running
10. upload results to the internet

This model can also be applied to other situations as well, i.e. cricket.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
What's the difference in skill between the grades?
- Use relegation elo etc. to determine?
- This would require multiple seasons of data. (maybe)
- How would elo corrections work? Linear conversion?
- For one season of data - lowest elo Grade A = highest elo Grade B?
- How similar are teams from one game to the next?

Evaluate a Park Factor Rating:
- Add information from the fixtures on the site as well.

Finally secured the data for the previous competitions in the league. This should be a big help in terms of creating more comprehensive analysis.

As the league will be presented these findings, I will need to include some information for the lay-person. This should probably mention some of the assumptions made in the data to give a closer understanding of the errors included in the methods
