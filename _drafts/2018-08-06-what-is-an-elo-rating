The most important part of elo ratings is to understand why they are a thing.
They seek to answer the question - who is best.

It’s pretty simple to figure out who’s better in a competitive game - you simply compete. But in situations with many teams or players, oeople might rarely play each other. Further, some players cannot play one another - most obviously because retired etc.

Elo ratings also seek to determine the likelihood of an outcome.

These points make it pretty clear why it was used to define the skill of chess players.
